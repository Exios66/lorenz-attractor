# Lorenz Attractor Documentation (Fixed)

This project simulates and visualizes the Lorenz Attractor using numerical methods such as the Runge-Kutta method (RK4).

## Background

The Lorenz Attractor is a system of ordinary differential equations originally studied by Edward Lorenz. It is notable for its chaotic solutions, meaning that small changes in initial conditions can lead to vastly different outcomes.

## Equations

The Lorenz equations are:

dx/dt = sigma * (y - x)

dy/dt = x * (rho - z) - y

dz/dt = x *y - beta* z

Where `sigma`, `rho`, and `beta` are parameters.

## Simulation

The simulation is implemented using the Runge-Kutta method (RK4). The RK4 method is a fourth-order numerical integration technique, which means it is accurate to the fourth power of the step size. This method is used to solve the Lorenz equations and obtain the trajectory of the system.

## Visualization

The Lorenz attractor is visualized using matplotlib. The Lorenz attractor is a three-dimensional object, so a three-dimensional plot is used to visualize it. The Lorenz attractor is a chaotic system, so the trajectory of the system is plotted in a three-dimensional space.
